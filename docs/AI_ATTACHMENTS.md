# Clack AI Attachments

This document records the attachment safety contract. All picker, workspace
`@` picker, and Explorer attachment paths must produce the same normalized
`AttachmentRecord` before the composer may send content to a model.

## Current limits

| Limit | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Attachments per message | 8 |
| Individual file | 8 MiB |
| Text or source file | 1 MiB of strict UTF-8 |
| Image payload | 8 MiB |
| Combined ready attachments | 20 MiB |
| Estimated decoded raster image | 64 MiB at 4 bytes per pixel |

The decoded-image limit is enforced from PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WEBP dimensions.
SVG files use the individual-byte limit and are not rendered as composer
thumbnails. Later image work may add stricter SVG and animated-image handling.

## Security contract

- Browser MIME values are hints only. Signature sniffing determines supported
  image, PDF, archive, and executable types.
- Text must have a known text extension or reported `text/*` type and must
  decode as strict UTF-8. Unknown binary data is never decoded as replacement
  text.
- Secret-denied names such as `.env`, credentials, and private keys are blocked
  by the existing AI secret-path policy before content is loaded.
- Workspace-path attachments are canonicalized, checked by the secret policy,
  and then read by a Tauri command that requires the path to remain inside an
  authorized workspace root.
- Directories and non-regular filesystem entries cannot be attached.
- Rejected and not-yet-supported files remain visible with a specific reason;
  they are not silently omitted or sent to a model.

## Current delivery

Attachment bytes are stored once under Clack's app-data `ai-attachments`
directory. Files are named by their SHA-256 content hash and written
atomically. Message history contains a small `data-clack-attachment` reference,
not raw text or a base64 data URL.

When a request is sent, the transport reads and integrity-checks the referenced
content. Bounded text and source files become transient delimited text with
JSON-escaped metadata. Bounded images become transient AI SDK image parts. The
transcript renders compact attachment cards and loads image thumbnails only
near the viewport.

Identical content is deduplicated. In-memory leases protect unsent and active
content from cleanup. Startup and session deletion reconcile the store against
persisted references; unreferenced files and abandoned staging files are
removed. Existing persisted data-URL attachments migrate when their chat is
opened. A failed migration preserves the original history.

PDF, ZIP, RAR, 7z, and unknown binary files are identified honestly but remain
unsupported until their dedicated processing checkpoints are implemented.
